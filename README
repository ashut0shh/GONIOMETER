This is the repo for a goniometer that measures the angle of the movement of the knee joint and helps to identify the gait cycle of the person , consequently 
we use a flex sensor for measuring the angle as well as a IMU (BNxxx55)which is used to claibrate small drones therefore shd be more accurate
we are averaging the IMU measurement and the flex sensor measurement in order to improve accuracy
we use a 500 mAH li-po battery to power the entire ckt
we use a boost converter in order to bring the 3.7V from the lipo to a 5V source
we use arduino nano as the main Microcontroller for this



we embedded the flex sensor on a knee cap which placed the flex sensor on the back of the knee and the IMU on the upper right calf
we use a nano on the thigh to power both modules


to make the flex sensor work we need to create a voltage divider ckt in order to pull up the current and allow the change in resistance fo the flex sensor to give us proper 
analog values that we can use to calibrate and measure the angle of movement

more additions to come soon
